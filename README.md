# EM BAKERY FARM
This a Smart Contract that is a cloned implementation of Yield Farming.

To have it runnig on your machine, run the following commands after cloning.

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

Tests are still a WIP. 

You can deploy your version to any Testnet of choice, using:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_v2.js --network <network>
```

I recommend using goerli network
 
 &nbsp;

## The contracts are deployed on the Goerli Testnet
